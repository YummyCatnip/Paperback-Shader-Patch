# What is this?
An edit of Paperback's ``hologramv2.fs`` shader so the mod can run on mobile using the APK from [Balatro Mobile Maker](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker).

The method of install the mod on android is as follows [Lovely / Steamodded 1.0 mods on Android #137
](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker/issues/137).

It should also work on PC without problems, but I still recommend the original for it: [Paperback Mod](https://github.com/GitNether/paperback).
